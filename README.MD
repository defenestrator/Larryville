## A quick way to create a new Laravel project, initialize a git repo locally, and push it to Github

### Eventually this might be an awesome Laravel configuration system, maybe.

____
#### Requirements:

- A Bash-like shell. Maybe [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)?
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with access to create repos.
- [httpie](https://httpie.io)
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)  
- [laravel/installer](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/installer)

The Personal Access Token should (for safety) be configured thusly:
